# Robot Gravity

You are making a robot to explore other planets. Your robot has a gravity sensor but you want to 
have a back up way to determine the current gravity in case the sensor is damaged.Your robot has
the ability to jump and it has an height sensor that asynchronously scans about every .01 seconds.
Use those features to determine the current acceleration due to gravity as a positive number
within 0.1 units.

Use these members from `Robot robot`:
- `robot.Jump`
- `robot.MaxJumpForce`
- `robot.HeightSensor`
- `robot.Mass`

<summary>Hint #1</summary>

The equation for the vertical position of a projectile is `p = -.5*g*s^2 + v*s + i` where
- `p` is vertical position
- `g` is acceleration due to gravity
- `s` is time
- `v` is initial velocity (in this case initial velocity is the parameter to `robot.Jump` divided by `robot.Mass`)
- `i` is initial vertical position (in this case i is always 0)

</details>

<summary>Hint #2</summary>

`robot.HeightSensor` is an event. You need to make an event handler with the same method signature and subscribe to the event.

```cs
void HandleHeightSensor(double height, DateTime time)
{
	// some code here...
}

robot.HeightSensor += HandleHeightSensor;
```

</details>
